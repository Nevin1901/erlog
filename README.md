## erlog

erlog is a simple lightweight logging platform. you can log events from your code, and then they will show up in the backend

it uses sqlite for now, but we're switching to something that can scale. problem is: it needs to be SIMPLE. if you have any ideas prs are welcome

Very early access

## running

`go run -tags json1 main.go`

### looking for people to help build the commercial version

will be hosted by us and will be easier for the customer. dm Nevin#7114 on discord if you want to be a part of it.

doesn't matter what you do so long as you're dedicated to building the worlds next logging software
